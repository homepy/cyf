Well, the logo of github is a lovely cat, so this project is named Meow.
Here is just a Java project for my practice created by maven.


Modules:

meow-jdbc, accessing relational database with JDBC, such as Spring JDBC, MyBatis and Hibernate. Now it is empty.

meow-cassandra, accessing Apache Cassandra 2 with the Datastax CQL Java driver.

meow-batch, scheduled task with Quartz.

meow-jms, message driven bean with spring-jms and activeMQ.

meow-webapp, Web Application with Spring MVC, jQuery and Bootstrap.
